<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael! (he/him)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who loves getting his hands dirty in <em>any</em> kind of code, but my biggest love is the front-end, and working directly with users. I have 
  experience scaling up enterprise UIs in React/TypeScript codebases, and am happy to talk your ear off about why TypeScript is both the greatest and worst thing in the world.

  <p>
    Lately I've been using my programming skills to make games and interactive media. I'm also a fan of
    <a href="https://devon.lol/blog/the-old-web/">the non-commercial web</a> and want to do my part in making 
    the internet weird again. I have a lot of love and respect for communities like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/">Sadgrl.online</a> that aim
    to help bring back what used to make the 'net so special.
    If you're interested at all, <a href="https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto">their manifesto's</a> a really good place to start.
