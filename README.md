<h3>Hi, I'm Michael!</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who loves getting his hands dirty in <em>any</em> kind of code, but my biggest love is the front-end, and working directly with users.

  The internet should be for everyone. Not only does that mean that we should be taking the greatest pains to meet accessibility standards, but it also means that it's our responsibility to make all the draconian, super-technical things we work with as approachable and usable to non-technical people as possible.

  Professionally, I have experience scaling up enterprise UIs in React/TypeScript codebases. But in my free time, I also like using these programming skills to make games
  and interactive media. I'm also a fan of the non-commercial web and want to do what I can to make it weird again. It used to be such a bright and vibrant place, and I love
  that communities like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/">Sadgrl.online</a> have sprung up to help fix this.
