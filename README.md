<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael! (he/him)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who loves getting his hands dirty in <em>any</em> kind of code, but my biggest love is the front-end, and working directly with users. I have 
  experience scaling up enterprise UIs in React/TypeScript codebases, and am happy to talk your ear off about why TypeScript is both the greatest and worst thing in the world. 
</p>

<p>
  The internet should be for everyone. Not only does that mean this we should be taking the greatest pains to meet accessibility standards, but it also means that it's our 
  duty as developers to make all the draconian, super-technical things we work with as approachable and usable to non-technical users as possible.

    Lately I've been using my programming skills to make games and interactive media. I'm also a fan of the non-commercial web and want to do my part in making 
    the internet weird again. It used to be such a bright and vibrant place, and I love that communities like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/">Sadgrl.online</a> have sprung up 
    to help bring back what used to make things so special.
