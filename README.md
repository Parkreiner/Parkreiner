<h3>Hi, I'm Michael! (he/him)</h3>

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who loves getting his hands dirty in <em>any</em> kind of code, but my biggest love is the front-end, and working directly with users. I have 
  experience scaling up enterprise UIs in React/TypeScript codebases, and am happy to talk your ear off about why TypeScript is both the greatest and worst thing in the world.

  The internet should be for everyone. Not only does that mean this we should be taking the greatest pains to meet accessibility standards, but it also means that it's our 
  duty as developers to make all the draconian, super-technical things we work with as approachable and usable to non-technical users as possible.

<h4>Fun Facts</h4>

  In my free time, I also like using these programming skills to make games and interactive media. I'm also a fan of the non-commercial web and want to do what I can to make 
  it weird again. It used to be such a bright and vibrant place, and I love that communities like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/">Sadgrl.online</a> have sprung up to help 
  bring back what used to make the internet so special.
